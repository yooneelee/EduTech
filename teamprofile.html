									<h2>Alex Lee</h2>
									<p>My name is Alex Lee (s3769561), pronounced like 'uni' in university. My background is South Korean. However, since I was born and raised in Melbourne my Korean has a slight Australian accent. Some interesting facts about me include being a brown belt in judo, hit diamond in league of legends and working at Uniqlo! Initially I began to try programming, learning languages such as Java, Python and C++. Although it was interesting and fun at times, I soon discovered programming was not for me. Then, I was introduced to the world of Cybersecurity. This field has everything I was interested in as it allowed me to delve in deeper to the ethical and social aspects of technology usage.</p>

								<p style="font-style: italic;">"These results will make me more wary when participating in group activity. For example, my 16 personality test shows that I may be quite shy. Therefore, I need to be proactive and communicate when I am in a group setting. Furthermore, as I am receptive to change and new ideas I believe this will be beneficial in group settings as many group members will be pitching in their unique perspectives. Lastly, understanding that I am a visual learner, I will be making sure that I am paying full attention when we are discussing as a group to maximise my understanding of the topic."

									<h2>Nathan Fahey</h2>
									<p>My name is Nathan Fahey (s3896547), I am a 5th generation Australian and this is my first year at RMIT. I enjoy playing footy in my spare time and a big fan of the West Coast Eagles. My interest in IT started about 10 years ago when I first started playing Minecraft after a friend had recommended the game to me. After being swiftly hooked on the game, constantly playing the vanilla version was getting stale and repetitive so I started becoming more interested in the mods available for download from the internet for Minecraft. This involved modifying files and programs on my computer, something which I had never done before but I found fascinating and rewarding. I know a medium amount of python as that was the main programming language I used for Year 12 Software Development as well as knowing lesser amounts of html and visual basics that I learnt during high school.</p>

								<p style="font-style: italic;">"My introversion means that working in a team will be difficult for me and effective communication is a skill that I have little of. Being a thinker means that I am more likely to work slowly and think of a smart solution to a problem rather than rushing through it and making mistakes."

									<h2>Sena Tatar</h2>
									<p>My name is Sena Tatar (s3900872) and I am a Turkish student studying Information Technology and this is my first year in RMIT. In my free time, I love to play games and draw digitally. Ever since the introduction of Minecraft, I have constantly been around computers, may it be for gaming or coding small projects. So far, I enjoyed making a small 2D-Platformer game on Unity and want to develop further to advancing into 3D games.</p>

								</p>
								<p style="font-style: italic;">"I have a very laid back style, I don’t really care about small details and live life at a calm pace. When I’m not doing any projects, I am reserved and often comfortable in my own area. For this trait, I am most probably an easy going person when in a team, an important aspect when establishing a group and working towards a project."

									<h2>Anson Tran</h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Anson Tran (s3906959). I was born in Melbourne Australia. I’m an Australian born Chinese and I speak English and Cantonese. My previous education is VCE and a Diploma of Screen and Media. I enjoy reading books, especially ones abouts history and fantasy. My favourite childhood book series is the Peter Jackson series. My interest in IT lies in the infinite possibilities that can happen due to it. Technology is ever-evolving and new trends are seemingly pushed out every single year. I’ve always been amazed at how fast technology has been moving and how easy it has made our lives. Some IT experiences I had stems more from the realm of installing hardware infrastructure and setting up the devices for the users.</p>

 								</p>
								<p style="font-style: italic;">"Honestly, I don’t believe much will change how I would normally work in a team. I’ll simply follow the team leader and provide thoughtful and valid input when the need arises. Should mostly be smooth sailing. I’ve experience in working in teams with a variety of differing personalities and am flexible enough to work with them."

									<h2>Piper Harris</h2>
									<p>I am Piper Harris (s3899854) and I have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from the year I lived in Perth in 2007 and 2007. My favourite things to do is to travel and play basketball. I started playing basketball when I was about 6 and have been playing ever since. I love going on overseas trips especially and exploring the world. My family goes on international holidays annually, which was unfortunately disrupted by COVID last year. It is really hard to pinpoint when exactly my interest in IT started, as I have always been intrigued in anything technology related. In primary school I applied to be an ICT monitor and was selected due to my natural computer skills I had picked up from playing around.</p>
									<p><b>Myers Briggs</b>- The Protagonist <br><b>Leadership test</b>-Transformative Leader <br><b>Learning Style</b>- Mostly Pragmatist Style
								</p>
								<p style="font-style: italic;">"Both the MBTI and the Leadership tests have indicated to me that I am very much a team player and would much rather work in a collaborative manner than individually. I agree with these results to a significant extent as I like to have people who I can share my ideas with and hear their own ideas and opinions, creating a positive attitude towards team related work. I think it is important, especially in a rapidly growing field such as IT, to have other people you can bounce thoughts and ideas off to create the ultimate outcome and solutions you can."
