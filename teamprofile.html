									<h2>Alex Lee</h2>
									<p>My name is Alex Lee (s3769561), pronounced like 'uni' in university. My background is South Korean. However, since I was born and raised in Melbourne my Korean has a slight Australian accent. Some interesting facts about me include being a brown belt in judo, hit diamond in league of legends and working at Uniqlo! Initially I began to try programming, learning languages such as Java, Python and C++. Although it was interesting and fun at times, I soon discovered programming was not for me. Then, I was introduced to the world of Cybersecurity. This field has everything I was interested in as it allowed me to delve in deeper to the ethical and social aspects of technology usage.</p>

									<h2>Nathan Fahey</h2>
									<p>My name is Nathan Fahey (s3896547), I am a 5th generation Australian and this is my first year at RMIT. I enjoy playing footy in my spare time and a big fan of the West Coast Eagles. My interest in IT started about 10 years ago when I first started playing Minecraft after a friend had recommended the game to me. After being swiftly hooked on the game, constantly playing the vanilla version was getting stale and repetitive so I started becoming more interested in the mods available for download from the internet for Minecraft. This involved modifying files and programs on my computer, something which I had never done before but I found fascinating and rewarding. I know a medium amount of python as that was the main programming language I used for Year 12 Software Development as well as knowing lesser amounts of html and visual basics that I learnt during high school.</p>

								<p style="font-style: italic;">"My introversion means that working in a team will be difficult for me and effective communication is a skill that I have little of. Being a thinker means that I am more likely to work slowly and think of a smart solution to a problem rather than rushing through it and making mistakes."

									<h2>Sena Tatar</h2>
									<p>My name is Sena Tatar (s3900872) and I am a Turkish student studying Information Technology and this is my first year in RMIT. In my free time, I love to play games and draw digitally. Ever since the introduction of Minecraft, I have constantly been around computers, may it be for gaming or coding small projects. So far, I enjoyed making a small 2D-Platformer game on Unity and want to develop further to advancing into 3D games.</p>

									<h2>Anson Tran</h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Anson Tran (s3906959). I was born in Melbourne Australia. I’m an Australian born Chinese and I speak English and Cantonese. My previous education is VCE and a Diploma of Screen and Media. I enjoy reading books, especially ones abouts history and fantasy. My favourite childhood book series is the Peter Jackson series. My interest in IT lies in the infinite possibilities that can happen due to it. Technology is ever-evolving and new trends are seemingly pushed out every single year. I’ve always been amazed at how fast technology has been moving and how easy it has made our lives. Some IT experiences I had stems more from the realm of installing hardware infrastructure and setting up the devices for the users.</p>

									<h2>Piper Harris</h2>
									<p>I am Piper Harris (s3899854) and I have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from the year I lived in Perth in 2007 and 2007. My favourite things to do is to travel and play basketball. I started playing basketball when I was about 6 and have been playing ever since. I love going on overseas trips especially and exploring the world. My family goes on international holidays annually, which was unfortunately disrupted by COVID last year. It is really hard to pinpoint when exactly my interest in IT started, as I have always been intrigued in anything technology related. In primary school I applied to be an ICT monitor and was selected due to my natural computer skills I had picked up from playing around.</p>
