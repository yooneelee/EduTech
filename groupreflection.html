								<h3> As a group </h3>
								<br>
								<p>Over the course of the two assignments our group was exceptionally good at communication and time commitment. 
									As a group we were able to easily communicate our ideas across with each other, making sure everyone’s opinion and voice is heard. 
									We were able to delegate tasks evenly and everyone felt that they were participating towards the final project. 
									Furthermore, everyone consistently used the tools provided and agreed upon. 
									For example, in our group we primarily used Microsoft teams and discord. 
									Everyone in the team was responsive within 24 hours of a message and majority of the time was present to the meetings scheduled (some were absent due to unseen circumstances). 
									Within teams, we utilised the platform by holding team meetings, using the whiteboard to collaboratively design a mock-up of our prototype, as well as using a collaborative word document. 
									Overall, there were no disagreements within the group.
 									<br>
									One major improvement from assignment 2 to assignment 3 is that we as a group focused on the importance of being collaborative and sharing the responsibilities. 
									In assignment 2 we were more structured and marginalised within our own responsibilities in tasks. 
									Even though we did help each other out in assignment 2, we had a much more team effort in making sure we read each other’s work and making sure our assignment had a good flow and an imprint from the whole team, not just one person. 
									Another component of our group that we tried to improve over the weeks was engaging in longer discussions in our team meetings. 
									Initially, our team meetings were short because we only focused on our individual tasks. 
									However, as we continued as a group and received feedback from our tutor, we decided to engage in longer team meetings to further analyse the assignment expectations and discuss each part as a team to ensure everyone is on the same page. 
									One aspect we learnt from working in a group is that everyone has different strengths and passions. 
									From this in future work groups we will be more aware to play to the strengths of other members and our own strengths as well. 
									In addition, one aspect we found surprising as a group was our mutual interests in similar fields such as gaming and the IT field.</p>
