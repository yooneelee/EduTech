								<h3> As a group </h3>
								<br>
								<p>Over the course of the two assignments our group was exceptionally good at communication and time commitment.
									As a group we were able to easily communicate our ideas across with each other, making sure everyone’s opinion and voice is heard.
									We were able to delegate tasks evenly and everyone felt that they were participating towards the final project.
									Furthermore, everyone consistently used the tools provided and agreed upon.
									For example, in our group we primarily used Microsoft teams and discord.
									Everyone in the team was responsive within 24 hours of a message and majority of the time was present to the meetings scheduled (some were absent due to unseen circumstances).
									Within teams, we utilised the platform by holding team meetings, using the whiteboard to collaboratively design a mock-up of our prototype, as well as using a collaborative word document.
									Overall, there were no disagreements within the group.
 									<br>
									One major improvement from assignment 2 to assignment 3 is that we as a group focused on the importance of being collaborative and sharing the responsibilities.
									In assignment 2 we were more structured and marginalised within our own responsibilities in tasks.
									Even though we did help each other out in assignment 2, we had a much more team effort in making sure we read each other’s work and making sure our assignment had a good flow and an imprint from the whole team, not just one person.
									Another component of our group that we tried to improve over the weeks was engaging in longer discussions in our team meetings.
									Initially, our team meetings were short because we only focused on our individual tasks.
									However, as we continued as a group and received feedback from our tutor, we decided to engage in longer team meetings to further analyse the assignment expectations and discuss each part as a team to ensure everyone is on the same page.
									One aspect we learnt from working in a group is that everyone has different strengths and passions.
									From this in future work groups we will be more aware to play to the strengths of other members and our own strengths as well.
									In addition, one aspect we found surprising as a group was our mutual interests in similar fields such as gaming and the IT field.</p>

								<p>I think the group worked very well in terms of communicating and taking responsibility for their respective sections. We were able to clearly demonstrate our ideas or discuss any concerns we had about the assignment. As communication is a major aspect in any successful group, I am pleased that we excelled in this area. One area that we could improve on as a team is understanding each other’s strengths and working with that in mind. In our group, we didn’t have a big discussion on what people’s strengths are in relation to the assignment. However, this allowed personal growth in learning new skills or advancing current knowledge in certain areas. One thing that was surprising is that everyone was responsible with their tasks and finished on time. Furthermore, if members were struggling or needed help they were vocal about it. This was surprising to members in my past groups who have not been so vocal and communicative. One thing I learnt about groups is that it you are able to complete so much working in a well functioning group. </p>

								<p>I am very happy with the group in which I completed these last two assignments with. All members were collaborative and completed all work they were assigned in a timely manner. Often times it is hard to find a group which works and communicates so well, however this group was extremely cooperative and we were always able to arrange times to meet.  I was surprised when I started working with this group, as we have not had any issues or people going missing halfway through the assignment. Everyone was quick to respond to any messages through our chosen communication platform Discord, and all meetings had majority in attendance. As we progressed as a group, we were able to talk in more depth and found out more about each other rather than just the IT topic at hand, which I think helped with our team dynamics. <br>We were all able to express our ideas for the project and which ways we thought would be the best to go about certain aspects, making this impartial and fully agreed upon. Our ability to all communicate our own ideas ensured that the outcomes of our assignment satisfied everyone, and we all understood the outlines and detail. One thing we definitely learned from assignment 2 was to spread the work load a bit more evenly. In the first assignment, we had two members take on a lot more work than everyone else. And while they weren’t unhappy about it, we realised that it should have been spread a little bit better. Overall, our team worked exceptionally well, and I am proud of the amount of work and detail we were able to achieve in the small amount of time allocated.

								<p>As a group I do not have any complaints. Everyone is co-operative and works to the best of their ability to contribute to the project. Each group member has contributed valuable and meaningful insight feedback for each other and excels in communication. What could be improved would mostly stem from my end in which I would have liked to start doing this assignment more earlier that way, there would be no extra stress.
</p>
									<p>A surprising thing I have noticed about the group dynamic was that it is co-operative and gets work done. Rejecting biases I have from opinions that my other university friends have from their own experiences and my own experience in another course. 
One thing I have learnt about group work is that it is quite hard work together as everyone has their own things to do, so communication is the bedrock of a good team. Planning is extremely important in maintaining good work flow and making sure that all team members know what they are doing and there are no overlaps in work.
