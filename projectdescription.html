									<h4>Roles</h4>
									<h5>Research and Development - Yoonee</h5>
									<p> In the early stages of EduTech, there is a great focus on research and development to complete a product suitable for teachers and students. 
									In this role, Yoonee will have the responsibilities in completing detailed research and analyses on the target market and the overall feasibility of our app. 
									Yoonee will conduct thorough research within schools working with the teachers and students to test the early Mathlete prototypes. 
									More responsibilities include detailing a report of the findings from the testing with the rest of the team to work on further upgrades and recommendations. </p>

									<h4>Testing</h4><p> EduTech is in the early days of research and development. 
											We are currently developing designs of the app and eventually working towards building a working prototype. 
											Therefore our ability to test our product is limited to showing designs and explaining our idea thoroughly to receive feedback on the feasibility of Mathlete. 
											An interview was conducted with a math primary school teacher Anthony Nguyen to receive feedback on whether Mathlete would provide benefits to students to learn maths and help facilitate the teaching of maths for teachers.
											<br>
											<h5>Importance of learning math</h5>
 										
											AL: Hi Anthony, thank you for meeting with me today. May I ask what age group or grades do you teach maths at Heany Park Primary School and what content do you go over in your curriculum?
											<br>
											AN: That’s okay. I teach Math to mainly 8-10 years old which is grades 3 or 4.  With this age group we mainly focus on building a strong foundation of mathematics and from there allow them to develop an understanding of mathematical concepts and use mathematical processes to solve practical, theoretical and abstract problems.
											<br>
											AL: Great. In your opinion, why do you think learning math is important for young students?
											<br>
											AN: Math is very significant for the growth of children because it’s a fundamental subject that allows different pathways for the future generations to explore. For example, maths provides a foundation and pathway to careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) industries. Also, on top of that, math is just everywhere in everyday life, whether we are trying to calculate 10% of items or trying to create budget plans. So, in the end, math is a very important skill that children need to have even if it is at a basic level.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts between e-learning and traditional learning</h5>
											AL: Interesting. So obviously you believe math is a fundamental skill that should be learnt by children. What is your view on e-learning and traditional learning? What is the best practice in your opinion?
											<br>
											AN: That’s an interesting question and one that I had to research during my time at university. So, generally the data shows that there is a slight advantage in e-learning. The difference is not that much but it is slightly skewed in favour of e-learning. Based on the research it is because children are more stimulated by what’s on an iPad rather than what’s in a book. They find it more fun and therefore more engaging. Whereas traditionally from a book, it makes the children think that ‘okay it’s homework’ or ‘it’s math’ and for those who don’t like homework won’t score particularly high. Personally, I like a mixture of both traditional and e-learning. I think the mix works well together because you don’t want kids to be glued to the screen all the time. For example, using other resources such as creating visual cues. In one of my glasses we use marbles to teach addition and subtraction. Little activities like that also prove to be quite effective. However, you’ll find a different opinion with another teacher or another school. There is no right way to teach at the moment.
											<br>
											AL: How has technology altered the way you approach teaching?
											<br>
											AN: It’s also important to note the recent trend with technology with more and more technology being introduced into the classroom such as iPads, electronic whiteboard and etcetera, we are in a position where children are growing up with technology being much more prominent in their learning. So, to sum up my thoughts, e-learning has a slight advantage over traditional book learning due to more engagement amongst children.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts on Mathlete & FIGMA prototype</h5>
											<h5>Anthony was shown FIGMA wireframes</h5>
											AL: So, our idea for our app is to help kids learn maths. We aim to try and make it more engaging by making it like a game with your own personal avatar and the ability to level up and unlock customisable features for your character. In terms of functionality, there will be three sections: homework, vs mode and practice mode. Teachers are also able to create the homework plans.  What are your thoughts? Do you think this is something that would be helpful in your classroom?
											AN: Firstly, I would say yes, it is something that I would use in my classrooms, if it is easy to use for the teachers and the kids. I can definitely see the benefit in this application. I can see students liking the app and treating it more as a game. My only concern would be whether if one of the students gets stuck on a question, what features do you have to help them? But other than that, I can see this application being very useful for setting weekly homework or in class activities as well.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Improvement or suggestions</h5>
											AL: Following on from that feedback, are there any suggestions of improvement? Or areas we need to look out for regarding education?
											<br>
											AN: I think just making sure that you keep the gaming aspect separate from the learning aspect. What I mean is that in the end, your number one priority is that you want to help the kids learn maths in a fun interactive way. As long as that is your number one goal, I think it should be okay.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Testing reflection</h5>
											The interview provided great insight on many topics. We were able to gain a greater understanding on the importance of educating the early generation with fundamental math skills. Furthermore, we understood that empirically there was evidence that showed e-learning proved to be a slightly better method to teach basic math skills Rashty (2013). However, teaching methods are dependent on teacher preferences and student circumstances. For example, not every student may be able to afford an iPad. Moreover, other teaching methods may be preferred to younger children with activities using visual cues such as marbles to visually demonstrate addition or subtraction. Lastly, Anthony highlighted that it is important that there needs to be a clear feature that helps the student understand what their mistakes were or a guide to help solve the question, rather than just simply provide the answer. 
											Using this information, we were able to develop more features to improve our application. In the development phase we plan to implement a feature that shows the students how to solve the questions they got wrong. Here we can use visual cues such as marbles to maximise visualisation and understanding. More interviews with teachers across the primary and secondary schooling will provide a greater in depth understanding of our target market and our ability to create a fully functioning app.

									<h4>Group Processes and Communication</h4><p>To communicate to each other as a group we use a server on the messaging service discord. We send any messages we want to communicate to the other members of the group as well post links for accessing google docs or any other files we need to share. We do 2 group meetings per week using Microsoft Teams to either discuss roles for the assignment or each person's progress with the assignment. Discord has a feature where you can ping someone’s username and it sends them a direct notification of your message. We use this feature if we want to quickly communicate to everyone or a specific person; every time someone has been pinged in our group, they have responded within 24 hours, so we have not had any issues with people not responding to messages.</p>
									<p>However, if there was an issue where a group member did not respond to messages at all and did not contribute, the rest of us would contact the teacher of our subject and notify then of our group member’s absence. Our minimum expectancy for each member is to satisfactorily complete each of their assigned parts of the assignment before the due date. Additionally, group members should respond to messages directed towards them promptly or whenever they are available to do so.</p>
