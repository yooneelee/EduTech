									<h4>Plans & Progress</h4>
									<p>First person perspective written by Nathan:</p>
									<p>The idea for this project started when I was contemplating project ideas to feature in my first assignment for Introduction to Information Technology. After procrastinating and struggling to think of an idea, the idea to make a game was thought of. I am passionate about video games and thought a project making a game would be fun. After even more rigorous thought, I decided to turn to Google for inspiration. Upon searching for app ideas, there was a website that featured a suggestion of making a maths learning game for children. I decided to select this idea, thinking that it would be simple to make, while also being able to incorporate more complex elements. Expanding on the idea for my first assignment, I decided to make it a game that features rapid succession of short maths questions. The inspiration for this plan was multiplication flash cards called MTK cards that are used by children to practice the times tables. The app will feature addition, subtraction, multiplication and division questions for young children to solve maths equations to practice and get better at maths.</p>
									<p>The app would require to be fun for children to want to use it. My idea to help this was to make the app colourful with pop-up animations combined with positive sound effects to engage the children using the app. In 2014, The Guardian published an article that researched into the effects that addictive mobile games have on your brain and how they do so. Bright pop-up animations mixed with positive sound effects have been proven to reward your brain with dopamine. This causes the user to feel satisfied and encouraged when using an app which is something I wanted many students to feel when solving math equations. Students will hopefully have more fun doing maths using the app then they would be doing maths in class.</p>
									<p>Before the start of the second assignment, I joined a group of 4 others and as a group we would decide a project idea for our group assignment. Agreeing upon using my idea, we next spent 15 minutes discussing features and design choices for the app. We settled on an idea that made the app for schools and the public and could be used for school homework set by teachers.</p>
									<h5>Features</h5>
									<p>The app will be a maths game/learning app that will present rapid-fire flash card style maths questions to primary school students. A prototype of the app was originally planned to be made using MIT App Inventor but then was changed to Figma. It will be available on both android and iOS operating systems; it also will be available on both phones and tablets. The plan initially was to make the app for only android devices but that would be impractical for many students unless they were given an android device through the school. This plan was because MIT App Inventor originally supported only android but recently upgraded their support to iOS. This means when prototyping using MIT App Inventor iOS devices can be tested on and eventually used by students upon the app's release.</p>
									<p>The first screen will be a login screen. Accounts will be one of 3 options. There will be accounts for students, accounts for teachers and accounts for the general public who want to use the app as well. The home screen for students has three options which are called ‘Homework’, ‘VS’ and ‘Practice’. Public accounts will not feature a ‘Homework’ option.</p>
									<p>For the ‘Homework’ section, we decided to make it a feature where teachers can enter specific questions themselves that they want their class to be tested on for homework. Classes are a feature that only teachers have access to; the teacher will add the account names of their students to a class that they created (e.g., Grade 5B Mathematics) to easily keep track of and manage their students all in one place. The created homework will go into the student’s homework section on the app. To better keep track of the homework, it is divided into each week that it is due. Students can view their homework that the teacher set after choosing a specific week.</p>
									<p>The ‘VS’ section is for users to challenge their friends or classmates to see who can correctly answer maths questions faster. Upon pressing the ‘VS’ button it brings you to a screen where the user can type in the VS code of a person they want to challenge. Also on this screen is the user’s VS code. VS codes are a unique string of characters for each account. Choosing a particular person to challenge sends them a pop-up message asking them to accept or decline your challenge. The two users participating in the challenge will be asked the same ten questions and whoever answers more questions correctly in a faster time will be declared the winner.</p>
									<p>The ‘Practice’ section will feature options for answering addition, subtraction, multiplication and division questions. This section is for students who want to practice maths questions in their free time to get better at maths. There will also be a button at the top of the screen that takes you to the user’s profile. The user will have their character as a profile picture for the profile section. This character is customisable, more information on this section is down below. The profile section itself will contain a list of achievements to motivate the user. In a finished app these achievements will likely be ‘Answer 50 questions’, ‘Answer 100 questions’ and ‘Achieve xp level 10’. More information about xp levels will be in motivation down below.</p>
									<p>For the maths questions themselves, they will pop up on the screen and the student will type in their answer to the question in a text box next to the question. There will be four maths operations which are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Questions by default will be randomly generated depending on the operation and difficulty they are for, unless they are questioning a teacher set for homework. Each operation will have three difficulty settings which will be called ‘Grades 1-2’, ‘Grades 3-4’ and ‘Grades 5-6’. Difficulty settings will be aimed at grade levels because younger children will be new to learning maths and therefore require easier questions and older children will require harder questions. Grades 1-2 questions will have questions with only one-digit numbers (e.g., 3x2 or 9-4); most of the questions will be addition and subtraction with smaller amounts of multiplication and division questions as these students are very new to maths so they start with simple questions. Grades 3-4 questions will have two-digit numbers (e.g., 12x11 or 15+14) as students have learnt the foundations of maths and will be able to answer more complex questions; multiplication will not feature numbers above 12, as schools only teach multiplication questions featuring numbers as high as 12 at this grade level. Grades 5-6 questions will have larger two-digit numbers and even some three-digit numbers (e.g., 80x4 or 118+51). The student will have their grade level already associated with their account.</p>
									<p>If the student answers a question incorrectly, the answer will appear on screen. They then have as much time as they need to press the button to move to the next question while they think about why they got the last question wrong. Students will have their statistics saved which are the number of questions they have answered, and the number of questions answered correctly for each maths operation. The statistics are for the teacher to check students' progress but are also visible to students, so they can see their progress out of interest. These statistics will be the same as what the students have access to as well as showing how many questions the students timed out on so the teacher can see if a student is struggling. The type of questions presented to the students would be based on the Victorian Maths Curriculum set out by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority. As mentioned prior.</p>
									<h5>Colour Scheme</h5>
									<p>Choice of colour is important when designing a colour scheme for the interfaces on the app. ‘Sh!ft’ published an article in 2021 that details ways that colour psychology can make learning more effective. Strong and bright colours should be used sparingly and should match with neutral colours such as black or white. Text on the screen should be easily readable meaning it should not clash with background colours.</p>
									<p>Studies show that students can learn and recall information better when learning from colour images as opposed to black and white images. In our app, colourful designs will be important for students retaining the answers for the questions they solve. We initially thought that the main colour scheme for our app could be green. After experimenting when making some basic designs using Figma we decided to use a blue colour scheme instead. This inspiration stemmed from ‘Mathletics’ which we decided to emulate some features from. Their main colour scheme is also blue, a cool (opposite of warm) colour that helps calm the user when something seems too complicated; this is something we want to achieve if a struggling student is feeling overwhelmed when solving questions.</p>
									<h5>Motivation</h5>
									<p>When thinking of how to motivate the students into being proactive when doing maths questions, we thought of two ideas. The first idea is to have an experience points (xp) system; this would entail students receiving experience points for correctly answering questions to reach a higher experience point level. Upon reaching a higher level the student will unlock items to customise their own character. There are also achievements for the student to complete and they will be rewarded with either xp or items for their character. The achievements are visible when viewing the user’s profile screen. Their character will be unique to the student’s account based on their customisations. The idea behind the experience points and the character customisation is to motivate the students to do maths questions so they can show off their high experience point level or custom character to their friends.</p>
									<p>This rationale stems from research in motivation for achievement within the classroom environment. There are two main types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic. The first stems from the individual themselves, whilst the latter stems from the environment affecting the individual. Studies have confirmed the correlation between the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of attention and memory. (Lucy j. Robinson, Lucy H. Stevens, Christopher J.D. Threapleton, Jurgita Vainiute, R. Hamish McAllister-Williams, Peter Gallagher, Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on attention and memory).</p>
									<p>Therefore, following the direction of the previous idea, another way to extrinsically motivate students for success is to have a leader board that ranks each student by the number of correct questions that they have answered. There will be several leader boards including leader boards for a specific class, grade level and an app-wide leader board for every student that uses the app. The motivation behind this is that many students will want to solve maths questions to compete against their friends or for the more ambitious students they can compete with every student who uses the app. This idea is backed by research on the effects of competition on educational outcomes. In which competition would generate greater performance within a student in outcomes such as tests. However, it does produce negative effects in self-evaluation if not properly utilised as a method of motivational stimulus. (Shui-fong Lam, Pui-shan Yim, Josephine S. F. Law, Rebecca W. Y. Cheung 2001, The Effects of Classroom Competition on Achievement Motivation)</p>
									<p>Both ideas involve encouraging the students to solve copious amounts of equations and this learning style is called rote learning. Studies have shown that rote learning is effective in young children because their brains are malleable. Rote learning has been found to change the structure of the brain. By practising rote learning exercises, students are able recall more information overall and often can retain it for life. Researchers have also found that a poor short-term memory can make it difficult to master reading and math concepts. Learning some information by rote frees up the short-term (or working) memory to concentrate on other areas.</p>
									<h5>Unused Ideas</h5>
									<p>An idea that we thought of as a group but later decided not to do was instead of using a text box for students to input their answers, we could have a box for the user to draw their answer in. We decided not to do this because implementing a feature that would require the app to interpret the poorly drawn numbers of the students to be too advanced for our skills.</p>
									<p>Another similar idea that we also are not going to implement would be a blank box for the user to draw their working out on. This would simulate the blank space on written maths equation sheets that students write on to solve questions that are too hard to solve just mentally. However, implementing this feature on phones would be difficult because of the limited space of the phone to fit a blank space sizable enough to draw on with the other necessary features of our app.</p>
									<p>To not require working out space we have made the questions only include simple equations (no long division) that can be solved in the student’s mind. Students that may struggle with maths and need working out space will therefore use traditional pencil and paper for working out tricky equations. If we were a professional company making this app, we would include this feature somehow as it is particularly useful for inputting answers or working out.</p>
									<h5>Design and Prototyping</h5>
									<p>Architecture - After testing out the MIT app inventor it was discovered that the tool did not meet the specifications required for the development of the Mathlete application. In consideration of this EduTech would be developing the application from scratch using Swift. The development life cycle would be done following the Scrum methodology as we aim to involve as much of the customer input as appropriate to deliver an amazing and life changing product.</p>
									<p>The reason MIT App inventor was originally chosen is because we were looking for a straightforward way to make an app. MIT App Inventor presented itself to make an app without needing knowledge in coding. Looking through the features of the software seemed adequate for making a prototype for the application at first glance. However, after trying out, it was realised how poorly made MIT App Inventor really is and unsuitable for our project. A compiled list of all the issues that were present with the app inventor includes:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>When you place an object on the screen it is automatically centred and placed at the top of the screen or directly under any other item. It cannot be moved or placed in a specific location</li>
										<li>There are no options for creating and placing shapes on the screen, the only objects you can place on the screen are buttons, images, text boxes and other similar objects such as lists</li>
										<li>You cannot add text on the screen</li>
										<li>The name of the first screen on your app cannot be changed</li>
										<li>If you type an incorrect input, the app notifies you via a popup window in your browser</li>
										<li>There are permanent blank spaces at the top and bottom of the screen on your app</li>
										<li>It requires several attempts to delete an object before it is successful</li>
										<li>You cannot share the project with someone else and allow them to edit it. Other people may only preview your project by downloading a .zip file you send them</li>
										<li>Resizing an image is done by manually inputting your desired size for the image; this is imprecise and often results in the image becoming distorted</li>
										<li>The programming is achieved using blocks that represent functions within your software; navigating the menus when wanting to find a specific block is often difficult and time consuming</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Struggling to make even just one of the many screens needed for the Mathlete prototype, it was decided that the best thing to do is to give up on MIT App Inventor and instead create a more basic prototype in Figma instead. Prototyping using Figma is limited in terms of its functionality because it is made for mainly showing the design of the project rather than its interactive features.</p>
									<h5>Platforms</h5>
									<p>We are aiming to have this application on mobile applications, focusing mainly on iPads and then mobile phones. Since this application is intended for school usage our development would be done on Apple first before moving forward to Android and possibly onto a website. Thus, would use Xcode (Apple’s IDE) to develop the application.</p>
									<h5>Communications</h5>
									<p>The application would be connected to EduTech databases, which would be hosted through Amazon Web Services’ Amazon RDS, as the students and teachers would need to create accounts to access the application. Due to the reason, we are a small start-up by using Amazon RDS we only simply pay for what resources we use and can scale our processes the more our user base grows.</p>
									<h5>Security</h5>
									<p>To make sure that our user base is secure and can safely make an account with Edutech we would be heavily reliant on Amazon doing most of the heavy lifting regarding our database system which would store all our users’ account details. Our development team would utilise the built-in security features of Apple devices to enforce strong user authentication and of course will also offer patches to update the features and security of the application.</p>
									<h5>Testing Phase</h5>
									<p>During the first 1-3 weeks, our research and development team will focus on conducting interviews with teachers and students to gauge whether our app is something they would want to use in their classrooms and at home.</p>
									<p>We hope to interview at least 50 teachers and students with similar line of questioning:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Why do you think learning math is important for children?</li>
										<li>E-learning vs traditional learning?</li>
										<li>Thoughts on our app design and functions?</li>
										<li>Improvement and suggestions?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>This section of the testing phase is significant as it will help us build a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding of what teachers think of the cons and pros of our idea and what can be improved on to be suitable for students. User testing can also be accomplished through the platform usertesting.com, a website in which companies can pay users to test out their products/services.</p>
									<p>From the research and information, we collect we will then begin a 6-week development phase to build a working prototype of the app. From this point, we will begin tests with students and teachers using the app.</p>
									<p>During the development cycle testing would occur during the final stages of development. Here we would firstly be doing an in-house technical test, where every component will be thoroughly tested for bugs. All features will be put in through test exercises to expose any weak areas or glitches which will be documented down and fixed prior to deployment.</p>
									<p>Before alpha testing, Edutech would plan out the process of our alpha try-outs by asserting the user personas which would be testing the application. Although the application caters to primary school children, the other stakeholder in this would be the teachers. The user personas would encapsulate both sides so our development teams would not only obtain information on how the children are using the application, but also on how teachers are using the application to augment their teaching.</p>
									<p>Questions that need to be asked when defining our user personas include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>What problems do they have?</li>
										<li>What solutions do they need?</li>
										<li>What solutions can be provided?</li>
										<li>What would make this user use the application on a daily basis?</li>
										<li>What features are they looking for?</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Secondly, we will test the application through Alpha testing. Our methodology for gathering participants for our Alpha and Beta test phases would be to contact primary level schools' authorities to set up an agreement in which EduTech would provide an alpha build of the application to the math teachers and they would implement it in a live classroom environment. By doing this user testing we would be able to obtain live data on the usability and relevance our app has on the learning the children would undertake.</p>
									<p>Here our goals would be to determine the level of impact the application has on the students by measuring KPIs such as test score levels, percentage of use etc. We would also aim to get feedback on the design of the application from students and teachers, giving valuable insight towards the final design of the application.</p>
									<h5>Deployment Phase</h5>
									<p>Deployment of the application would firstly occur on the Apple App store. This first stage would provide a platform in which potential user groups may download the application for usage. Next our marketing team would be negotiating with specialised schools first before reaching out to mainstream schools. Coming onto the idea of putting the application on the Apple app store it was discovered that it is necessary for a general account to be available to users as not all schools would have implemented the application into their curriculum thus children would still be able to download and use the application with features taken out of the education version of the application.</p>
									<p>An idea that came up was for EduTech to partner up with Education Horizons Group (a group that deals with implementing software solutions to schools). This way not only would EduTech be able to deploy the application but also fulfil the need to gather up a user base. This would possibly work more effectively than simply cold-calling schools in hopes of attaining a working partnership when EduTech has not established a reputation within the education sphere as a technology provider.</p>
									<p>A website should also be built near the end of the application development cycle. This website should serve as a contact point in which our user base can contact EduTech and potential partners may have a look at our product offerings. While not as important as obtaining contacts, it would serve as a main hub for communications.</p>

									<h4>Roles</h4>
									<h5>Research and Development - Yoonee</h5>
									<p> In the early stages of EduTech, there is a great focus on research and development to complete a product suitable for teachers and students.
									In this role, Yoonee will have the responsibilities in completing detailed research and analyses on the target market and the overall feasibility of our app.
									Yoonee will conduct thorough research within schools working with the teachers and students to test the early Mathlete prototypes.
									More responsibilities include detailing a report of the findings from the testing with the rest of the team to work on further upgrades and recommendations. </p>
									<h5>Lead UX Designer - Piper</h5>
									<p>Piper’s role as lead UX designer is to work on all of the development aspects of the product, specifically focusing on the design and usability side. Her main job is to ensure the user has a smooth experience with the product from start to end, working closely with other colleagues to satisfy this requirement. She will always be looking for ways to improve the product, to guarantee it is useful for users and also troubleshoot any problems which may be faced along the way.
									</p>
									<h5>Nathan - Lead App Developer</h5>
									<p>In this role, Nathan is leading the creation of the app as well as planning the wide variety of features that will be present in the app. Nathan created the idea for this app originally, so he is responsible for developing the app based on his original vision. He will guide the others through the planning phases and present his ideas while also taking feedback into account. Another responsibility of his is to create a functional prototype of the app using wireframes. Nathan will eventually be the leader for the development of a functioning version of the app.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>Scopes & Limitations</h4><p>In planning the components of our application, we split up our different “levels” into three categories by age. We had “Grade 1 and 2”, “Grade 3 and 4” and “Grade 5 and 6”, which would be options given to the teacher when setting up their classroom. Further, within each of these age categories, the math is then split into the four different operators, addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. We would also have 3 “game modes”  where students can either answer questions for practice, compete against friends in their class, or complete their homework set by their teacher. <br>Of course, all these different categories would take a lot of time to develop for every single option listed. On top of this, we planned to include many features such as XP and leaderboards, aimed to motivate students by giving them goals to work towards and prizes to unlock which they can use to customise their character.<br>After playing around with the MIT app inventor, it was found to be too fiddly and was a struggle to use in executing a prototype, thus we decided to move to Figma to complete this. Figma does not allow us to make a fully functioning app, and only allows us to do certain things such as this button takes you to this screen. Because of this switch aspects like the XP feature would not be functioning, and animations would be limited if any are able to be included. Using Figma would highly affect the outcome of our prototype, as only basic commands and key paths can be executed.
									<br>In our app development, we wanted to implement the use of a whiteboard type of feature, which would allow users to do easy working out, or enter their answers in that way. We came to the consensus, based on our own experiences, that some aspects of math would require working out, such as long division, and by supplying them with a draw box we are providing them with accessible working out space. Given the time frame and experience of group members, we have decided to only use a text box for all questions, however, with further development, we would have hoped to eventually include the draw box.</p>

									<h4>Testing</h4><p> EduTech is in the early days of research and development.
											We are currently developing designs of the app and eventually working towards building a working prototype.
											Therefore our ability to test our product is limited to showing designs and explaining our idea thoroughly to receive feedback on the feasibility of Mathlete. As a team we decided that for the first 6 weeks we will conduct surveys with teachers and students to gain knowledge in the following areas why do you think learning math is important for children, e-learning vs traditional learning, thoughts on our app design and functions and lastly, Improvement and suggestions. After the initial testing phase we then plan to create a working alpha prototype to then use to test with teachers and students for more in depth testing. We will use this stage to receive more feedback about the design and the usability of the app.
											An interview was conducted with a math primary school teacher Anthony Nguyen to receive feedback on whether Mathlete would provide benefits to students to learn maths and help facilitate the teaching of maths for teachers.
											<br>
											<h5>Importance of learning math</h5>

											AL: Hi Anthony, thank you for meeting with me today. May I ask what age group or grades do you teach maths at Heany Park Primary School and what content do you go over in your curriculum?
											<br>
											AN: That’s okay. I teach Math to mainly 8-10 years old which is grades 3 or 4.  With this age group we mainly focus on building a strong foundation of mathematics and from there allow them to develop an understanding of mathematical concepts and use mathematical processes to solve practical, theoretical and abstract problems.
											<br>
											AL: Great. In your opinion, why do you think learning math is important for young students?
											<br>
											AN: Math is very significant for the growth of children because it’s a fundamental subject that allows different pathways for the future generations to explore. For example, maths provides a foundation and pathway to careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) industries. Also, on top of that, math is just everywhere in everyday life, whether we are trying to calculate 10% of items or trying to create budget plans. So, in the end, math is a very important skill that children need to have even if it is at a basic level.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts between e-learning and traditional learning</h5>
											AL: Interesting. So obviously you believe math is a fundamental skill that should be learnt by children. What is your view on e-learning and traditional learning? What is the best practice in your opinion?
											<br>
											AN: That’s an interesting question and one that I had to research during my time at university. So, generally the data shows that there is a slight advantage in e-learning. The difference is not that much but it is slightly skewed in favour of e-learning. Based on the research it is because children are more stimulated by what’s on an iPad rather than what’s in a book. They find it more fun and therefore more engaging. Whereas traditionally from a book, it makes the children think that ‘okay it’s homework’ or ‘it’s math’ and for those who don’t like homework won’t score particularly high. Personally, I like a mixture of both traditional and e-learning. I think the mix works well together because you don’t want kids to be glued to the screen all the time. For example, using other resources such as creating visual cues. In one of my glasses we use marbles to teach addition and subtraction. Little activities like that also prove to be quite effective. However, you’ll find a different opinion with another teacher or another school. There is no right way to teach at the moment.
											<br>
											AL: How has technology altered the way you approach teaching?
											<br>
											AN: It’s also important to note the recent trend with technology with more and more technology being introduced into the classroom such as iPads, electronic whiteboard and etcetera, we are in a position where children are growing up with technology being much more prominent in their learning. So, to sum up my thoughts, e-learning has a slight advantage over traditional book learning due to more engagement amongst children.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts on Mathlete & FIGMA prototype</h5>
											<h5>Anthony was shown FIGMA wireframes</h5>
											AL: So, our idea for our app is to help kids learn maths. We aim to try and make it more engaging by making it like a game with your own personal avatar and the ability to level up and unlock customisable features for your character. In terms of functionality, there will be three sections: homework, vs mode and practice mode. Teachers are also able to create the homework plans.  What are your thoughts? Do you think this is something that would be helpful in your classroom?
											AN: Firstly, I would say yes, it is something that I would use in my classrooms, if it is easy to use for the teachers and the kids. I can definitely see the benefit in this application. I can see students liking the app and treating it more as a game. My only concern would be whether if one of the students gets stuck on a question, what features do you have to help them? But other than that, I can see this application being very useful for setting weekly homework or in class activities as well.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Improvement or suggestions</h5>
											AL: Following on from that feedback, are there any suggestions of improvement? Or areas we need to look out for regarding education?
											<br>
											AN: I think just making sure that you keep the gaming aspect separate from the learning aspect. What I mean is that in the end, your number one priority is that you want to help the kids learn maths in a fun interactive way. As long as that is your number one goal, I think it should be okay.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Testing reflection</h5>
											The interview provided great insight on many topics. We were able to gain a greater understanding on the importance of educating the early generation with fundamental math skills. Furthermore, we understood that empirically there was evidence that showed e-learning proved to be a slightly better method to teach basic math skills Rashty (2013). However, teaching methods are dependent on teacher preferences and student circumstances. For example, not every student may be able to afford an iPad. Moreover, other teaching methods may be preferred to younger children with activities using visual cues such as marbles to visually demonstrate addition or subtraction. Lastly, Anthony highlighted that it is important that there needs to be a clear feature that helps the student understand what their mistakes were or a guide to help solve the question, rather than just simply provide the answer.
											Using this information, we were able to develop more features to improve our application. In the development phase we plan to implement a feature that shows the students how to solve the questions they got wrong. Here we can use visual cues such as marbles to maximise visualisation and understanding. More interviews with teachers across the primary and secondary schooling will provide a greater in depth understanding of our target market and our ability to create a fully functioning app.

									<h4>Group Processes and Communication</h4><p>To communicate to each other as a group we use a server on the messaging service discord. We send any messages we want to communicate to the other members of the group as well post links for accessing google docs or any other files we need to share. We do 2 group meetings per week using Microsoft Teams to either discuss roles for the assignment or each person's progress with the assignment. Discord has a feature where you can ping someone’s username and it sends them a direct notification of your message. We use this feature if we want to quickly communicate to everyone or a specific person; every time someone has been pinged in our group, they have responded within 24 hours, so we have not had any issues with people not responding to messages.</p>
									<p>However, if there was an issue where a group member did not respond to messages at all and did not contribute, the rest of us would contact the teacher of our subject and notify then of our group member’s absence. Our minimum expectancy for each member is to satisfactorily complete each of their assigned parts of the assignment before the due date. Additionally, group members should respond to messages directed towards them promptly or whenever they are available to do so.</p>
