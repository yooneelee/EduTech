									<h4>Roles</h4>
									<h5>Research and Development - Yoonee</h5>
									<p> In the early stages of EduTech, there is a great focus on research and development to complete a product suitable for teachers and students.
									In this role, Yoonee will have the responsibilities in completing detailed research and analyses on the target market and the overall feasibility of our app.
									Yoonee will conduct thorough research within schools working with the teachers and students to test the early Mathlete prototypes.
									More responsibilities include detailing a report of the findings from the testing with the rest of the team to work on further upgrades and recommendations. </p>
									<h5>Lead UX Designer - Piper</h5>
									<p>Piper’s role as lead UX designer is to work on all of the development aspects of the product, specifically focusing on the design and usability side. Her main job is to ensure the user has a smooth experience with the product from start to end, working closely with other colleagues to satisfy this requirement. She will always be looking for ways to improve the product, to guarantee it is useful for users and also troubleshoot any problems which may be faced along the way.
									</p>

									<h4>Scopes & Limitations</h4><p>In planning the components of our application, we split up our different “levels” into three categories by age. We had “Grade 1 and 2”, “Grade 3 and 4” and “Grade 5 and 6”, which would be options given to the teacher when setting up their classroom. Further, within each of these age categories, the math is then split into the four different operators, addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. We would also have 3 “game modes”  where students can either answer questions for practice, compete against friends in their class, or complete their homework set by their teacher. <br>Of course, all these different categories would take a lot of time to develop for every single option listed. On top of this, we planned to include many features such as XP and leaderboards, aimed to motivate students by giving them goals to work towards and prizes to unlock which they can use to customise their character.<br>After playing around with the MIT app inventor, it was found to be too fiddly and was a struggle to use in executing a prototype, thus we decided to move to Figma to complete this. Figma does not allow us to make a fully functioning app, and only allows us to do certain things such as this button takes you to this screen. Because of this switch aspects like the XP feature would not be functioning, and animations would be limited if any are able to be included. Using Figma would highly affect the outcome of our prototype, as only basic commands and key paths can be executed.
									<br>In our app development, we wanted to implement the use of a whiteboard type of feature, which would allow users to do easy working out, or enter their answers in that way. We came to the consensus, based on our own experiences, that some aspects of math would require working out, such as long division, and by supplying them with a draw box we are providing them with accessible working out space. Given the time frame and experience of group members, we have decided to only use a text box for all questions, however, with further development, we would have hoped to eventually include the draw box.</p>

									<h4>Testing</h4><p> EduTech is in the early days of research and development.
											We are currently developing designs of the app and eventually working towards building a working prototype.
											Therefore our ability to test our product is limited to showing designs and explaining our idea thoroughly to receive feedback on the feasibility of Mathlete. As a team we decided that for the first 6 weeks we will conduct surveys with teachers and students to gain knowledge in the following areas why do you think learning math is important for children, e-learning vs traditional learning, thoughts on our app design and functions and lastly, Improvement and suggestions. After the initial testing phase we then plan to create a working alpha prototype to then use to test with teachers and students for more in depth testing. We will use this stage to receive more feedback about the design and the usability of the app.
											An interview was conducted with a math primary school teacher Anthony Nguyen to receive feedback on whether Mathlete would provide benefits to students to learn maths and help facilitate the teaching of maths for teachers.
											<br>
											<h5>Importance of learning math</h5>

											AL: Hi Anthony, thank you for meeting with me today. May I ask what age group or grades do you teach maths at Heany Park Primary School and what content do you go over in your curriculum?
											<br>
											AN: That’s okay. I teach Math to mainly 8-10 years old which is grades 3 or 4.  With this age group we mainly focus on building a strong foundation of mathematics and from there allow them to develop an understanding of mathematical concepts and use mathematical processes to solve practical, theoretical and abstract problems.
											<br>
											AL: Great. In your opinion, why do you think learning math is important for young students?
											<br>
											AN: Math is very significant for the growth of children because it’s a fundamental subject that allows different pathways for the future generations to explore. For example, maths provides a foundation and pathway to careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) industries. Also, on top of that, math is just everywhere in everyday life, whether we are trying to calculate 10% of items or trying to create budget plans. So, in the end, math is a very important skill that children need to have even if it is at a basic level.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts between e-learning and traditional learning</h5>
											AL: Interesting. So obviously you believe math is a fundamental skill that should be learnt by children. What is your view on e-learning and traditional learning? What is the best practice in your opinion?
											<br>
											AN: That’s an interesting question and one that I had to research during my time at university. So, generally the data shows that there is a slight advantage in e-learning. The difference is not that much but it is slightly skewed in favour of e-learning. Based on the research it is because children are more stimulated by what’s on an iPad rather than what’s in a book. They find it more fun and therefore more engaging. Whereas traditionally from a book, it makes the children think that ‘okay it’s homework’ or ‘it’s math’ and for those who don’t like homework won’t score particularly high. Personally, I like a mixture of both traditional and e-learning. I think the mix works well together because you don’t want kids to be glued to the screen all the time. For example, using other resources such as creating visual cues. In one of my glasses we use marbles to teach addition and subtraction. Little activities like that also prove to be quite effective. However, you’ll find a different opinion with another teacher or another school. There is no right way to teach at the moment.
											<br>
											AL: How has technology altered the way you approach teaching?
											<br>
											AN: It’s also important to note the recent trend with technology with more and more technology being introduced into the classroom such as iPads, electronic whiteboard and etcetera, we are in a position where children are growing up with technology being much more prominent in their learning. So, to sum up my thoughts, e-learning has a slight advantage over traditional book learning due to more engagement amongst children.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Thoughts on Mathlete & FIGMA prototype</h5>
											<h5>Anthony was shown FIGMA wireframes</h5>
											AL: So, our idea for our app is to help kids learn maths. We aim to try and make it more engaging by making it like a game with your own personal avatar and the ability to level up and unlock customisable features for your character. In terms of functionality, there will be three sections: homework, vs mode and practice mode. Teachers are also able to create the homework plans.  What are your thoughts? Do you think this is something that would be helpful in your classroom?
											AN: Firstly, I would say yes, it is something that I would use in my classrooms, if it is easy to use for the teachers and the kids. I can definitely see the benefit in this application. I can see students liking the app and treating it more as a game. My only concern would be whether if one of the students gets stuck on a question, what features do you have to help them? But other than that, I can see this application being very useful for setting weekly homework or in class activities as well.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Improvement or suggestions</h5>
											AL: Following on from that feedback, are there any suggestions of improvement? Or areas we need to look out for regarding education?
											<br>
											AN: I think just making sure that you keep the gaming aspect separate from the learning aspect. What I mean is that in the end, your number one priority is that you want to help the kids learn maths in a fun interactive way. As long as that is your number one goal, I think it should be okay.
											<br><br>
											<h5>Testing reflection</h5>
											The interview provided great insight on many topics. We were able to gain a greater understanding on the importance of educating the early generation with fundamental math skills. Furthermore, we understood that empirically there was evidence that showed e-learning proved to be a slightly better method to teach basic math skills Rashty (2013). However, teaching methods are dependent on teacher preferences and student circumstances. For example, not every student may be able to afford an iPad. Moreover, other teaching methods may be preferred to younger children with activities using visual cues such as marbles to visually demonstrate addition or subtraction. Lastly, Anthony highlighted that it is important that there needs to be a clear feature that helps the student understand what their mistakes were or a guide to help solve the question, rather than just simply provide the answer.
											Using this information, we were able to develop more features to improve our application. In the development phase we plan to implement a feature that shows the students how to solve the questions they got wrong. Here we can use visual cues such as marbles to maximise visualisation and understanding. More interviews with teachers across the primary and secondary schooling will provide a greater in depth understanding of our target market and our ability to create a fully functioning app.

									<h4>Timeframe</h4><p> askfnkdsgn dknfk lkdnsfk ksdn faldnkf lkadn fandkfn ownf dksnf skdfn</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>Risks</h4><p>Finding the perfect software to develop particular features can be a very difficult task, thus creating risks. Using one software can never ensure that all of our criteria for creating our application is fully met, creating problems when trying to develop our app. We originally chose to use the MIT App Inventor to design working prototypes for ‘Mathlete’, with all of these ideas in our heads and expectations of what we could make. However, having high expectations of what we want to create, paired with the limitations brought by the applications we use, will make a huge impact on how our final product will turn out. If we decide to keep using MIT App Inventor we will be limited to the features that can be created, but thus risk not being able to produce a prototype that is effective in conveying the features planned for the application. <br>The risk we faced was MIT not working how we expected it to, making it too difficult to design our prototype and pushing us to use Figma to complete it. We were able to overcome the risk, however were not able to have the fully functioning features included that we had planned to when originally discussing the product.
									<br>There is also the risk of wanting to use software which members of EduTech are not too familiar with or have little experience with. Software such as Adobe XD, AWS, and XCode are not very well known amongst our group, which would make further development difficult. Trying to learn and familiarise ourselves with new technologies would be very time-consuming, as well as may not lead to the same outcome in comparison to a platform where someone may have experience or knowledge. To eventually reach the goals set in terms of an end product, software like these would be necessary to implement all of the features planned, however lack of knowledge would decrease efficiency on the project, as well as potentially fail to maximise the full use of the software chosen.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>Group Processes and Communication</h4><p>To communicate to each other as a group we use a server on the messaging service discord. We send any messages we want to communicate to the other members of the group as well post links for accessing google docs or any other files we need to share. We do 2 group meetings per week using Microsoft Teams to either discuss roles for the assignment or each person's progress with the assignment. Discord has a feature where you can ping someone’s username and it sends them a direct notification of your message. We use this feature if we want to quickly communicate to everyone or a specific person; every time someone has been pinged in our group, they have responded within 24 hours, so we have not had any issues with people not responding to messages.</p>
									<p>However, if there was an issue where a group member did not respond to messages at all and did not contribute, the rest of us would contact the teacher of our subject and notify then of our group member’s absence. Our minimum expectancy for each member is to satisfactorily complete each of their assigned parts of the assignment before the due date. Additionally, group members should respond to messages directed towards them promptly or whenever they are available to do so.</p>
