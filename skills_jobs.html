									<h1>Skills & Jobs</h1>
									<p>Let us suppose that a group of venture capitalists hears about your project, and is so impressed that they wish to fund you to develop it further for say six months. 
									You will be the manager of a team of 4 people to deliver the project outcomes. 
									What position description would be appropriate? Write 4 position descriptions for people that you would employ to take your project to the next phase. 
									You will need to consider what skills are appropriate, which may include specific technical expertise, team work experience, leadership and management techniques, and innovative thinking.</p>

								<h3> Accountant </h3>
								<br>
								<h4>About the Role</h4>
								<br>
								<p>As a startup, we expect most of our funds to come from ownerâ€™s equity and funding from other interested parties. 
								Furthermore, every member in our team has limited knowledge in finance and budget planning. 
								In addition, since we are assuming we are receiving funds from a Venture Capitalist, we as a group have decided it is best to hire an accountant with degrees related in commerce (or a similar field) to handle our financial operations within our business. 
								This includes creating and maintaining relevant files such as balance sheets, cash flow sheets and income statements.</p>
								<h4>Key Responsibilites</h4>
								<ul>
  									<li>Maintaining accurate, relevant and timely financial records such as balance sheets and income statements.</li>
  									<li>Prepare and distribute company reports- Finance, Sales and Management on weekly and monthly basis.</li>
  									<li>Assist with month end and year end processes, including balance sheet reconciliations, compliance, audits and reporting within stipulated deadlines.</li>
									<li>Prepare and present operational forecast(s) for financial and operational reporting.</li>
									<li>Manage stocktake of inventory to ensure accurate collection of date and provide reports on inventory status against plan.</li>
									<li>Undertaking reviews of financial reports and data.</li>
									<li>Strategise financial plans to reduce costs and maximise profits.</li>
								</ul>
